This tool has been created to factory reset IGEL thin clients.
Tested with firmware version 4, 5 and 10.

## Motivation
If you are a proud owner of a IGEL thin client whith a lost configuration you would like to reset it.
This requires to generate a challange (terminal key) which must be send to IGEL support.
IT people often work after sunset during hours without the IGEL service being reachable.
That frustrated me especially because I did want to reset more than one device. 

## Requirements
* linux/darwin system
* installed pycryptodome package
* python3

## How to install

Install pycryptodome and clone the git repo:
```
~ # pip install pycryptodome
~ # git clone https://github.com/thomasDOTwtf/free_stacheltier.git
```
## How to use

Boot the your IGEL thin client and press ESC multiple times after the initial beep.
You'll see the following Menu. 
Choose "Factory Reset"
